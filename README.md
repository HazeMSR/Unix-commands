# Unix-commands
Some basic unix commands

## System information

- uname: Shows device and kernel information.
```
# Shows architecture of the current server
uname -m

# Shows kernel
uname -r

# Shows all the options of the OS
uname -a
```

- man: Manual of any command
```
# Syntax: man [command]
man uname
```

## Directories

- ls: List the files of the current directory:
```
# Normal
ls

# Include hidden files and details
ls -lsa
```

- mkdir: Make a new directory in the current path or another path:
```
# Make a directory named mydir
mkdir mydir

# Make a new directory inside mydir called as mydir2
mkdir mydir/mydir2
```

- cd: Go to the given directory:
```
# Enter to a simple directory
cd mydir
 
# Out of the current directory
cd ../

# Enter to a nested directory
cd mydir/mydir2
```

- tree or lstree: Shows the structure of the current directory
```
tree
```

## Files
- touch: Creates a new file
```
# creates a empty file
touch example.txt
```

- vi: Opens the text editor.
Tips.
VI works with Mnemonic commands for example:
  - Press "i" key in order to switch to "Insert" mode.
  - Press "v" key in order to switch to "Visual" mode.
  - Press "ESC" key to exit any mode.
  - Press : key in normal mode in order to input commands like save with the "w" key and "q" key to exit VI.

```
# First press I, then enter a random text then press ESC and finally press :wq and ENTER key in order to exit and save

vi example.txt

Some random text 1
Some random text 2
Some random text 3
Some random text 4
Some random text 5
Some random text 6


----INSERT----
:wq!
```
- cp: Copy a file or a directory
```
# Syntax: cp original_file destiny_file
cp example.txt example2.txt

# Copying your file to one directory up
cp example.txt ../example3.txt
```

- mv: Move or rename any file or directory
```
# Syntax: mv original_file destiny_file
mv example2.txt another_example.txt

# Moving your file to one directory up
mv another_example.txt ../
```

- rm: Remove any file or directory

```
# Removing a simple file
touch deleteme.txt && rm deleteme.txt

# Removing a directory
mkdir dir1 && rm -R dir1
```

- cat: Shows the content of a file
```
cat example.txt
```

## Permissions

- chmod: Change who can execute, write and read any file or directory
```
# Syntax: chmod [permissions] [file]
# Permissions with Mnemonic. u: user, g: group, o: others, r: read, w: write, x: execute

chmod ugo+rwx example.txt

# Permissions with Octal. 1st position user, 2nd position group, 3rd position others, 4: read, 2: write, 1: execute, 0: no permission.
#Â You can add any numbers in order for obtain different combination of permissions, for example 7 represents all the permissions.

chmod 740 example.txt
```

- chown: Change the owner of a file or directory
```
# Syntax: chown [user]:[group] file
# If you only want to change the user you don't have to specify the group

chown anotheruser example.txt

# Or specify the group also
chown anotheruser:anothergroup example.txt
```

## Descriptors and Pipes
In Unix process we have different types of descriptors:
0. stdin: It is used to input data or files into a command.
1. stdout: It is used to redirect the output of a command to another command or file.
2. stderr: It is used to indicate the errors of the command.

First lets try to list a directory that doesn't exists and also the home directory. In this case will be "tests" directory:
```
ls -l /home /tests
```
It will display something like this:
```
ls: /tests: No such file or directory
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  25 Mar 18 08:16 /home -> /System/Volumes/Data/home
```
The first output it's stderr output because it doesn't exists. 
Then it shows the stdout output result of listing the /home directory, now we can try to output this result to a random file,
using the > operator:

```
ls -l /home /tests 1> success.txt
```
The above command will create a new file call success.txt which contains the correct output of stdout because we specify to redirect to the 1 output, which belongs to sdtout. Now we will try using the stderr:

```
ls -l /home /tests 2> errors.txt
```
The above command will create a new file call errors which contains the errors of the command, it's important to specify the 2 output because it belongs to stderr. Now we will try to use both at the same time:

```
ls -l /home /tests > both.txt 2>&1
```

In the above command first we have to specify the normal redirection symbol in order to indicate the file that will be writted, then we have to specify the outputs, the stderr and stdout will be attached using the "&" operator.

Also we can append text to another file instead of overwrite it with the following operator:

```
echo "Whatever" >> success.txt
```
Also if we need to use the output of the command as input of another command we can use the operator pipe or '|':

```
ls -l | cat
```

## Grep & Find
- grep: It is used to search patterns inside the content of a file
```
# Syntax: grep [pattern] [file]
grep text example.txt
```
- find: It is used to find files or directories with the given pattern
```
# Syntax: find [directory] --name [pattern]
find ./ --name '.txt'

```
